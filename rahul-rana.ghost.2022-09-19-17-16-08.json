For four years, I went to a business administration magnet program, in other words, a specialized high school geared towards all things business. High school itself was quite a turning point in my life. By senior year, I was in the top 5% of my class, an international piano performer (and winner!), president of the business program that I previously mentioned, on the executive board of two more clubs, and so much more.

But, I treated it as a blank slate and made it my own. I worked to spark the entrepreneurship ecosystem there along with doing a ton of networking, which I quickly realized was futile.

One thing I did was check the opportunities pages of Stanford, Harvard, and UPenn organizations. Its public info anyway. I also attended events and recruiting sessions for other top schools.

Fun fact—my first idea was to write about how the private sector was solving public sector problems, such as those in the insurance, healthcare, and other hyper-politicized industries. But, as I began researching, I really did not have any intrinsic motivation to do so. I considered that a sign for a pivot. I went back to that introspective mindset and really, really thought about it. I asked why I loved venture capital so much, why I love deeptech.

I realized I love it all in the summer before college, although its roots began during my childhood. My dad works at Bell Labs and has been there since before I was born. As a kid, he'd take me to the labs across New Jersey. I became obsessed with the history behind the storied research lab and wanted to win a Nobel Prize of my own as I saw those of the Bell Labs legends. Not to mention, the mini museum in the Murray Hill lab—it got me so excited. </p><p>Funny enough, in high school, I fell into the finance crowd and pushed aside any curiosity for science and tech. For four years, I went to a business administration magnet program, in other words, a specialized high school geared towards all things business. High school itself was quite a turning point in my life. By senior year, I was in the top 5% of my class, an international piano performer (and winner!), president of the business program that I previously mentioned, on the executive board of two more clubs, and so much more. I really put a lot into the work I did, admittedly for the chance to go to a solid college. Long story short, life happened and I got rejected from 14 straight colleges. All of my dream schools. </p><p>Following that came a dark moment in my life—seemed like reality hit me for the first time. A ton of introspection lead me to really consider what made me happy and fulfilled. Did I really enjoy investment banking? Did I really need to go to a top college? At the time, I thought my professional path was ruined by going to a state school. </p><p>For months, I thought about what I want to do in the long run. My curiosity for deeptech resurfaced, but my strengths and knowledge laid in all things non-technical: finance, sales, marketing, operations, business development, community building, etc. Thus, I decided to combine the two: deeptech venture capital. It was the chance to build and support the future; a job in which I would be paid to learn. How amazing is that? </p><p>At Rutgers, there is virtually no resources around startups. But, I treated it as a blank slate and made it my own. I worked to spark the entrepreneurship ecosystem there along with doing a ton of networking, which I quickly realized was futile. The many 30-minute conversations yielded nothing but false hope. I had all this energy and passion but didn't know where to channel it. </p><p>I realized that I had to be extremely resourceful. One thing I did was check the opportunities pages of Stanford, Harvard, and UPenn organizations. Its public info anyway. I also attended events and recruiting sessions for other top schools. Hopefully no one noticed a Rutgers kid in the zoom call. I was doing this for a few months during my first semester at college, until something huge happened. Not sure if it's just the universe looking out for me, or luck, or serendipity. Whatever it may be, the opportunity to write a book came across my lap, and I jumped at it. </p><p>The book journey started off randomly. In the matter of a few weeks, I made the decision and began writing my manuscript (January 2020). Fun fact—my first idea was to write about how the private sector was solving public sector problems, such as those in the insurance, healthcare, and other hyper-politicized industries. But, as I began researching, I really did not have any intrinsic motivation to do so. I considered that a sign for a pivot. I went back to that introspective mindset and really, really thought about it. I asked why I loved venture capital so much, why I love deeptech. The answer? <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Making-Moonshots-Rahul-Rana/dp/163676620X/\">Moonshot companies</a>. The crazy ones that positively impact the course of humanity. The ones that were the epitome of human potential. </p><p>From that point on, the rest is history. <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Making-Moonshots-Rahul-Rana/dp/163676620X/\">Making Moonshots</a> </em>was born.

Many people told me I was crazy and that it would be impossible, but that's the start of every moonshot idea. </p><p>I sorta had this dual mandate: not only learn as much as humanly possible about the concept but also write it in a valuable, concise, entertaining manner.

Opportunity after opportunity arose. </p><p>Jan-May 2020 = worked at an AI startup + began posting on twitter; Summer 2020 = began joining communities + worked at a moonshot nanotech startup.

Yet another serendipitous conversation occurred with my good friend Jack (NASJAQ), as I told him how it was a dream of mine to work at <a href=\"https://luxcapital.com/\">Lux Capital</a>—the epitome of deeptech venture investing and venture building. I told him about how I interviewed Josh Wolfe for my book, but I was honestly scared to ask to work for him.

Them hiring you should not be a waste\n      of their time or effort.\n    * Then, \"cold\" email them with the help of\n      hunter.io, rocket reach or anything else—below is a Notion doc for all\n      things cold emailing\n   \n   \n * Join communities * Discord, twitter, slack, etc. Some I'm in: Gen Z Mafia,\n      Ladder (Remote Students), Accelerated, Gen Z VCs, and many niche ones.\n   \n   \n * Twitter * LinkedIn sucks. Use Twitter for networking, conversing, and\n      connecting with people you'd like to meet (in the startup/VC realm). That\n      said, LinkedIn is great for sourcing companies and for talent.\n   \n   \n * Zone in on a few niches and make it your own * I'm doing it for deeptech and\n      moonshot companies. Focus on a few topics of interest and REALLY get to\n      know them. Be the best in the world about it.

It’s an important tool for deeptech founders because, as opposed to grants and other non-dilutive funding, dilutive funding comes with greater visibility into the deeptech ecosystem. Sure, it comes at a price, but dilutive funding has additional benefits that can position the deeptech startup for success. For example, broader networks, more press/promotion, and access to diverse advisors. </p><p>Active VCs</p><p>According to Different Funds, a fund-of-funds-structured portfolio management firm, 11 of the most active deeptech VC firms are as follows. These firms have experience investing in a myriad of industries.

Is the project able to be monetized or is it just pure research? The best strategy to have is to simplify your startup as much as possible and make the investor’s funding decision as seamless as you can. Remember the key distinctions about deeptech: it’s complex, it’s capital intensive, and it’s research-heavy. Easing investor concerns within those areas will give a higher probability of funding. On top of those factors, founders must also appeal to investors in the typical ways that any startup should. For example, investors favor founders with previous operating experience and those that have met tangible KPIs. That said, deeptech founders do not need to hit venture scale for their startups necessarily. The potential for hitting hyper-growth must be evident, but being in it is not always a necessity. </p><p>To reiterate, a partner at SOSV, another powerful deeptech fund, laid out common deeptech investing <a href=\"https://medium.com/sosv-accelerator-vc/deep-tech-investing-101-912e0243a9d7\">risks</a>.

Of course the venture ecosystem has flourished since then, and most deals\nthese days aren't driven by R&D innovations.\n\n\nToday,  “deeptech” entails the hard sciences and advanced technologies among any\nnumber of the following fields: \n\nThese startups are not making the next viral social media app or CRM software—\nthose with normal KPIs. Instead, they’re creating ingenious, sometimes\nradically-impactful, solutions to previously unsolvable problems— everything\nfrom environmental concerns to mind-controlled machines (yes, I’m serious).\nTherefore, out of the complex, research-driven nature of deeptech fields arises\na need for unique fundraising sources. Thus, the team at Contrary Capital wanted\nto make a quick guide on how to fund your deeptech idea. \n\n\n\n\nNon-dilutive funding methods\n\nNon-dilutive funding is about gaining capital without the founder losing equity\nin their company. It can range from government grant money to bank loans, as\nopposed to angel investing and venture capital. The former ensures that founders\ndo not lose any % of ownership, while the latter is an exchange of capital for\nequity. The following is a list of non-dilutive funding source\n[https://www.hullandknarr.com/non-dilutive-funding/#:~:text=In%20this%20way%2C%20non%2Ddilutive,ownership%20of%20the%20company%20itself.&text=Conversely%2C%20Dilutive%20financing%20is%20any,some%20ownership%20of%20the%20company.]\ns by R&D credit firm Hull & Knarr:\n\n * Loans generally require a credit check, collateral, and guarantors. And they\n   must be paid back with interest.\n * Grants, on the other hand, do not need to be repaid. There are several\n   different types of grants for small businesses and start-ups. Usually, they\n   require the submission of an application and, most of the time, are tied to a\n   specific project or business milestone. And the business is generally\n   required to provide status reports on the project and/or the business\n   milestones.\n * SBIR and STTR Programs offer funding from small seed grants for risky\n   research to large, multi-year contracts that support multi-faceted programs.\n   These programs focus primarily on projects that support the US Government\n   through the Department of Defense (DoD), National Institute of Health (NIH),\n   Department of Energy (DoE), and many others. SBIRs/STTRs are a great way for\n   businesses to work out the kinks of their technology and products before\n   reaching full commercialization.\n * Licensing is a good way to get upfront payments from industry partners as\n   well as regular monthly or quarterly payments to fund the business and\n   additional development.\n * Royalty Financing allows the business to receive cash in exchange for a\n   percentage of the company’s future revenues over a certain period and up to a\n   certain amount.\n * Tax Credits offset past, current, or future tax a business generates. They\n   can be refundable or non-refundable, meaning that the business receives them\n   even if there was no tax generated (refundable) or only if the tax was owed\n   (non-refundable).\n\nNon-dilutive funding is essential for any founder, deeptech or otherwise. That\nsaid, the following are three resources for non-dilutive funding that are geared\ntowards R&D-heavy projects and ventures. \n\nSBA SBIR/STTR\n\nTo sustain deeptech and research-driven ideas, the Small Business Administration\n(SBA) created the Small Business Innovation Research program (SBIR\n[https://www.sbir.gov/about]), which is a grant to incentivize small businesses\nto “explore their technological potential” and “profit from its\ncommercialization.” The mission is to stimulate technological innovation and\nmeet federal R&D needs. Eleven federal agencies participate:\n\n * Department of Agriculture\n   [http://nifa.usda.gov/program/small-business-innovation-research-program]\n * Department of Commerce - National Institute of Standards and Technology\n   [http://www.nist.gov/tpo/sbir/]\n * Department of Commerce - National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n   [http://techpartnerships.noaa.gov/SBIR.aspx]\n * Department of Defense [http://www.acq.osd.mil/osbp/sbir/]\n * Department of Education [http://www2.ed.gov/programs/sbir/index.html]\n * Department of Energy [https://science.osti.gov/sbir]\n * Department of Health and Human Services\n   [http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/sbir.htm]\n * Department of Homeland Security [https://sbir2.st.dhs.gov/portal/SBIR/]\n * Department of Transportation [http://www.volpe.dot.gov/sbir/index.html]\n * Environmental Protection Agency [http://www.epa.gov/ncer/sbir/]\n * National Aeronautics and Space Administration [http://sbir.gsfc.nasa.gov/]\n * National Science Foundation [http://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/]\n\nOn the SBIR website, you can find all of the relevant grants to your field of\nchoice. You must submit a solicited proposal, after which you enter into a\ncompetitive selection process. The proposal for applying entails a business\nplan, executive summary, cost proposal, and technical proposal. Furthermore,\neligibility requirements include a couple of factors— the most important being\nthat the awardee must qualify as a Small Business Concern (SBC) as defined by\nSBA regulations at 13 C.F.R. §§ 701-705. Here is an in-depth look into the rules\nfor eligibility, along with guidelines on ownership, non-profits, and more: PDF\n[https://www.sbir.gov/sites/default/files/elig_size_compliance_guide.pdf].\n\nTo begin the application process for SBIR funding, check out this roadmap\n[https://www.sbir.gov/how-to-apply]. In summary, applicants must qualify as an\nSBC at the time of the award and at any time after. The applicant must perform ⅓\nof the research or analytical effort in Phase I and ½ of the research or\nanalytical effort in Phase II. A qualified SBIR manager must approve any\ndeviations or changes in the research. Also, the applicant’s primary employment\nmust be at that SBC throughout the entire proposed project. Applicants must\nperform their R&D within the USA.\n\nThen, applicants must register in the SBA’s Company Registry Database and submit\na Proof of Registration. Next, applicants should identify the specific grant or\ngrants that they are looking for on the Solicitations List\n[https://www.sbir.gov/solicitations/open] part of the SBIR website. A\n“solicitation” is the specific grant opportunity. After locating the desired\nopportunity, applicants must submit a proposal for Phase I funding. This\nproposal varies by Agency, but typically includes a business plan, executive\nsummary, cost proposal, and technical proposal. For Phase II funding, applicants\nmust construct a commercialization plan with information about the company,\ncustomer and competition, market, intellectual property, financing, and\nassistance and mentoring. Finally, the selection process begins with grant\ndeadlines and funding schedules varying by Agency.\n\nIf selected, you enter the three-phase program:\n\n> “Phase I. The objective of Phase I is to establish the technical merit,\nfeasibility, and commercial potential of the proposed R/R&D efforts and to\ndetermine the quality of performance of the small business awardee organization\nprior to providing further Federal support in Phase II. SBIR Phase I awards\nnormally do not exceed $150,000 total costs for 6 months.\n> Phase II. The objective of Phase II is to continue the R/R&D efforts initiated\nin Phase I. Funding is based on the results achieved in Phase I and the\nscientific and technical merit and commercial potential of the project proposed\nin Phase II. Only Phase I awardees are eligible for a Phase II award. SBIR Phase\nII awards normally do not exceed $1,000,000 total costs for 2 years.\n> Phase III. The objective of Phase III, where appropriate, is for the small\nbusiness to pursue commercialization objectives resulting from the Phase I/II\nR/R&D activities.

To do that,\nI-Corps focuses on customer discovery and translating research from a laboratory\nto the public marketplace. \n\nI-Corps emphasizes that it is not about making a business plan or funding a\nscientific discovery. It is rather about “talking to customers, partners and\ncompetitors; encountering the uncertainty and excitement of creating successful\ninnovations, [and] getting out of the university laboratory to explore the\ncommercial potential is what the effort is about.” \n\nI-Corps cohorts run through hubs around the nation and a network of\nuniversities: There are 99 Sites\n[https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?https://venturewell.org/i-corps/directory-corps-nodes-sites/] \nand nine I-Corps Nodes nationwide:\n\n * Bay Area Regional I-Corps Node (BA)\n   [https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://bayicorps.com/]\n * DC/MD/VA Regional I-Corps Node (DMV)\n   [https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.dcicorps.org/]\n * I-Corps South Node (SOUTH)\n   [https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://icorpssouth.com/]\n * Innovation Node-Los Angeles (IN-LA)\n   [https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://lanode.org/]\n * Midwest I-Corps Node (MWIN)\n   [https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?https://www.midwesticorps.org]\n * New England Regional Innovation Node (NE I-Corps)\n   [https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://icorps.mit.edu/]\n * New York City Regional Innovation Node (NYCRIN)\n   [https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.nycrin.org/]\n * Southwest Innovation Corps (SWI-Corps)\n   [https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?https://www.swicorps.org/]\n * UNY I-Corps Node (UNY)\n   [https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://unyicorps.org/]\n\n(https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/i-corps/about.jsp)\n\nIn terms of applying to I-Corps, teams must have three primary members: a\ntechnical lead, an entrepreneurial lead, and an I-Corps mentor. There are about\n20-30 teams within one cohort. To apply, a team must submit an Executive Summary\nfound here [https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/i-corps/teams.jsp]. Linked \nhere [https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2018/nsf18515/nsf18515.pdf] is a PDF that goes\ninto greater detail about the solicitation (application) process. The program\nseeks to boost deeptech ventures that are ready to test the waters of a\ncommercial marketplace, regardless of industry. As for numbers, from 2012 to\n2018, there have been 63 cohort trainings, 1315 teams, 3745 trained individuals,\n271 universities/institutes/colleges, and representation from 47\nstates/D.C/Puerto Rico. As a result,  there have been 644 startups, which are\ntypically deeptech ones, with nearly $301mm in follow-on funding raised and 6\nacquisitions (Venture Well and I-Corps).\n\nOther\n\nTo find non-dilutive funding for deeptech ideas and ventures, always be sure to\ncheck out:\n\n * University-affiliated departments and research institutions\n * Tech Transfer Offices:  These are key, as most American research universities\n   have them. They are organizations that help translate academic knowledge and\n   research into possible startups— essentially, they aid in commercialization.\n   We recommend that founders go to Tech Transfer Offices at their universities\n   to talk with people who are familiar with their topic of interest.\n * Independent research institutions\n * Los Alamos National Laboratory\n * Oak Ridge National Laboratory\n * Santa Fe Institute\n * Bell Labs\n * Government agencies [https://www.grants.gov/]\n * Individual departments\n * NIH [https://www.nih.gov/grants-funding], DARPA, etc.\n * Independent foundations\n * Singularity University\n * PropelX [https://www.propelx.com/home]\n * Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative [https://chanzuckerberg.com/]\n * Schmidt Futures [https://schmidtfutures.com/]\n * Competitions\n * University pitch competitions\n * XPRIZE [https://www.xprize.org/]\n * Hello Tomorrow [https://hello-tomorrow.org/]\n\n\n\nDilutive funding\n\nDilutive funding is when a startup raises capital in exchange for equity and is\ncommonly attributed to venture capital (VC) funding and angel investing. It’s an\nimportant tool for deeptech founders because, as opposed to grants and other\nnon-dilutive funding, dilutive funding comes with greater visibility into the\ndeeptech ecosystem. Sure, it comes at a price, but dilutive funding has\nadditional benefits that can position the deeptech startup for success. For\nexample, broader networks, more press/promotion, and access to diverse advisors. \n\nActive VCs\n\nAccording to Different Funds, a fund-of-funds-structured portfolio management\nfirm, 11 of the most active deeptech VC firms are as follows. These firms have\nexperience investing in a myriad of industries. Some are thesis-driven, others\nare industry-specific, and others are agnostic in general.\n\n * Lux Capital [https://www.luxcapital.com/] \n * 8VC [https://8vc.com/] \n * Bessemer Venture Partners [https://www.bvp.com/] \n * Breakthrough Energy Ventures \n * Data Collective VC [https://www.dcvc.com/]\n * Eclipse VC [https://eclipse.vc/] \n * Energy Impact Partners [https://www.energyimpactpartners.com/]\n * Founders Fund [https://foundersfund.com/] \n * Insight Venture Partners [https://www.insightpartners.com/] \n * Khosla Ventures [https://www.khoslaventures.com/] \n * Playground Global [https://playground.global/ ]\n\nFunder Requirements\n\nEach VC firm has specific preferences and requirements on how they go about the\nfunding process (as any VC firm does, regardless of deeptech or not) That said,\nthe biggest factor for deeptech investors is simply: does it work? Is the\nproject able to be monetized or is it just pure research? The best strategy to\nhave is to simplify your startup as much as possible and make the investor’s\nfunding decision as seamless as you can. Remember the key distinctions about\ndeeptech: it’s complex, it’s capital intensive, and it’s research-heavy. Easing\ninvestor concerns within those areas will give a higher probability of funding.\nOn top of those factors, founders must also appeal to investors in the typical\nways that any startup should. For example, investors favor founders with\nprevious operating experience and those that have met tangible KPIs. That said,\ndeeptech founders do not need to hit venture scale for their startups\nnecessarily. The potential for hitting hyper-growth must be evident, but being\nin it is not always a necessity. \n\nTo reiterate, a partner at SOSV, another powerful deeptech fund, laid out common\ndeeptech investing risks\n[https://medium.com/sosv-accelerator-vc/deep-tech-investing-101-912e0243a9d7].\nWith this, we recommend that founders disprove these risks.\n\n * Team: investors are looking for scientist-entrepreneurs. Not one or the\n   other, but both.\n * Go-to-market: an important concept for any startup, but in deeptech, it’s\n   important to get active feedback from your target users to ensure they\n   understand the product/service.\n * Geography: the broader deeptech ecosystem is important and lucrative.\n   Founders should be active members in it for the full benefits.\n * Fundability: the biggest factor— deeptech startups must be research-driven\n   and commercialized.

What really interested me was why this article was going viral inside of Airbnb. According to company insiders, the article was a hot discussion topic among employees and was even discussed at board level.

But in reality, they are incredibly important for a couple reasons: reporting, long-term planning, restructuring, aligning goals, and managing/leading people. In simple terms, it reflects how the business is fundamentally composed and the responsibilities that come from it’s facets. They date back to 1855, with the first one being created and designed by Daniel McCallum, a Scottish-American railroad engineer and general manager of the New  York and Erie Railroad (drawn by George Holt Henshaw). The first org chart was the intricate, flowery tree-like diagram attached here. The original purpose of it was to depict the divisions of responsibilities and the number of employees in each department of the railroad system  that McCallum managed. McCallum believed that diagramming the   division of responsibilities would establish a sense of order and make relationships and hierarchies more clear. He also believed that it was a necessity to make all of this transparent.\"]]],[10,2],[1,\"p\",[[1,[],0,1]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"The next major evolution of the org chart came in 1896, when Herman Hollerith founded the Tabulating Machine Company. He created it after he was awarded a federal contract to develop a machine to count the number of immigrants to America at the height of the Industrial Revolution. The company took on multiple product launches, consolidations, and mergers, eventually being renamed to the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR). The business expanded quickly and needed a form of visualization for the relationships and hierarchies within it. Out of this  need came the org chart that  we know today: a nearly- symmetrical, pyramidal form with functional divisions. In addition, the divisions portrayed the geographical and departmental subcategories of each function. As a plot twist, the CTR went on to eventually become International Business Machines, or IBM.\"]]],[10,3],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"The CTR diagram popularized the org charts that we see today. After decades upon decades, org charts have seen innovation in themselves with different forms being applied to different types  of companies. For example, now we have more than just hierarchical org structures: Functional, Horizontal (flat), Divisional (market-based, product-based, geographic), Matrix, Team-based, and Network (hub-and-spoke) org structures. Considering all of that, the general consensus about org charts is that they reflect the dynamic of the company and that they are of critical importance to establish if the company wants to scale. Intuitively,  they show the structure of the company and everything that comes with it. This is, in fact, very important for people such as those in sales, recruiting, and management (product, project, general, etc.). Historically, companies tended to keep accurate org charts secret to protect against others poaching their employees or copying their structure. However, that perspective is changing. How, org charts are becoming more and more transparent, and The Org is capitalizing on that.  \"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"The Org’s website sheds some light into its mission and vision:\"]]],[1,\"blockquote\",[[0,[7],1,\"“Who are your company’s unsung heroes?

With their public-facing database, they plan to provide services such as job updates, job postings, and a platform for teams. While you can search for a specific business, The Org begins by categorizing institutions by their country or by their industry. Thus, users and followers of a specific country or industry can find relevant information for their own context without being bombarded by others. Then, users can log in and browse specific companies that match their target criteria and study how it is structured. At first glance, The Org only offers the chart of a company’s leadership team. For a deeper, more specific look into the structure, users have to make a free account (as of now) to access the niche information.  For example, here is the limited \"],[0,[8],1,\"org chart for Apple\"],[0,[],0,\".\"]]],[10,6],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Another key aspect of how The Org makes these charts is how they get the information. It would be extremely  tedious to contact every single company out there and interrogate them for their org charts, which are sometimes proprietary information. Thus, The Org crowdsources the information from people at these firms. They verify the people based on their official email formats from their company. Verified users can go into the org chart of their company and modify it by adding, deleting, or editing the existing structure. All of this is supported by The Org’s research team, which uses public data sources for some of the work as well. To clarify, The Org’s services are currently free of charge. They have not publicly announced their entire business model. \"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Altogether, The Org is setting out to solve a problem in professional social networks that Linkedin can’t: accurate organizational charts and company structure. LinkedIn has no way of keeping up with leadership teams and the unsung heroes that may get lost in a network of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd degree connections. Simply put, LinkedIn fails to put together a verified collection of current leaders and employees. Furthermore, a major pain point today is that organizations lack transparency in how they are built. Sometimes, they are not publicly available, are misleading, or are entirely outdated. This is where The Org shines. Wylonis and Jarbøl devised a solution to this by aggregating data from innumerable public data sources and then crowdsourcing the verification process. Currently, their product is free to use, but the business model has secretive plans to monetize in the future. Among other unknown plans, Wylonis said that The Org may place a premium on power searchers, such as sales, recruiting, and business development leaders, and give them access to even more tools. \"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"As they work towards their goal of mapping out every company, The Org has profiled 50,000 companies and 200,000 professionals in its database.

But, The Org — and a few other startups — recognize the market for transparency in companies, which is portrayed through organizational charts. Having a centralized and accurate collection of this information, not to mention crowdsourcing-induced network effects, provides a valuable, in-depth look into the company’s dynamics value for all of the stakeholders of a company. Even major venture capitalists realize this. Roelof Botha, partner at Sequoia Capital, says that “today, information about teams is unstructured, scattered, and unverified, making it hard for employees and recruiters to understand organizational structures.” The Org directly alleviates that concern with it’s community of verified organizational information. Many in Silicon Valley and tech ecosystems worldwide even agree that org charts have been the secret weapon to forging partnerships and business model innovation. Similarly, former LinkedIn executive Keith Rabois, who is also a board member for The Org, emphasizes the importance of accurate organizational charts: “up-to-date org charts can be useful for everything from recruiting to sales, but they are difficult and time consuming to piece together… The Org is making this valuable information easily accessible in a way we were never able to do at LinkedIn.” Considering all this, it becomes clear that The Org is undertaking a pain-staking task. But, their strategy in doing so is innovative in its own way. \"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[7],1,\"Community-driven crowdsourcing\"],[0,[],0,\". The Org strategically created a community of transparency and giving back that benefits them in the long run. Take their crowdsourcing strategy, which allows people to modify the organizational charts for their place of employment (users are verified by their company’s unique email addresses). The crowdsourced, wiki-style strategy allows for constantly updated organizational charts without The Org having to individually source the information through publicly available sources. It’s user-generated content, but as accurate and up-to-date as can be. Crowdsourcing is especially valuable because it allows The Org to focus on building out other services and forms of (future) monetization while spending tangibly less resources for it’s biggest product offering. This yields benefits such as:\"]]],[3,\"ol\",[[[0,[],0,\"Reduces management burden with the faster co-creation of org charts by the public\"]],[[0,[],0,\"The give-and-take nature creates an opportunity for greater customer engagement before other services are rolled out\"]],[[0,[],0,\"Data-driven network effects, or exponentially more value for all with one more user and their company’s org chart updates\"]],[[0,[],0,\"A platform for distributed value-add that creates a flywheel: more crowdsourcing → more submissions for their respective company’s org charts →  more accurate + constantly verified org charts →  more transparency and value for others → more crowdsourcing\"]]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[7],1,\"Data moats: Invade, then Conquer. \"],[0,[],0,\"The Org emphasizes transparency in how some of the most successful companies are structured, thus offering a resource for organizational structure for others. While there is no set guide on how to do so, the organizational charts allow external users to experiment with teams and leadership capacities within their own firm. Managing a design team? Check out Airbnb’s Chief Design Officer’s team. Leading an engineering team? Reference one from SpaceX. Curious how to establish a company hierarchy? Check out the hierarchy that Apple implemented to surpass a $1T market cap. The possibilities for experimentation are nearly endless. The biggest surface-level concern for this is that some companies may want to operate in stealth. But, The Org found that almost 99% of companies so far have been fine with their product. There have been very few cases of individual people asking to be taken off their company’s organizational chart, but most accept that transparency and showcasing talent is of the best interest of those inside and outside of the company. \"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"With that, the crucial thing to note is that The Org is playing a long-term game as it's keeping its products free while offering transparency in org charts and a plethora of other services. Keeping their business model free allows for more engaged users to incorporate their own content, which will ultimately bolster The Org’s defensibility. The data that The Org holds thus becomes proprietary and sets the stage for a potentially compounding \"],[0,[9],1,\"moat\"],[0,[],0,\". Coined by Warren Buffe, the term “moat” is a company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage over its rivals and protect its long-term profitability and market share. Data moats have enduring value because they enable companies to derive never-before-seen insights to serve their customers, enhance the products, or even sell B2B. Not only does The Org generate data, but they also extract key findings for their community that no one else can make. As they keep up with their rate of org chart generation, The Org will slowly become a leader in a niche that companies like LinkedIn could never appeal to. Yet, once they “invade” that niche and establish themselves as a leader in it, then they can “conquer” other operations without sacrificing bandwidth or customers. This means that as the company bolsters its data moat, there will be a point at which no other company can replicate the value of their product and at which they will have enough market share to delve into lateral services seamlessly. \"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"In the end, their grand vision is simple. 1) Report the org charts for every possible business they can. 2) Build a community of transparency and value.

The only aspect that they share is that both are trying to streamline the process of making organizational charts. \"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"However, another set of competitors that The Org faces are existing professional social networks— the biggest one undoubtedly being LinkedIn. LinkedIn has especially cornered the market for data and profiles about individual professionals, careers, and industries. At this point in time, LinkedIn is focusing on lowering the COVID-19-induced unemployment rate by working with Microsoft to teach 25 million people digital skills for a post-COVID economy. That said, the company has some glaring faults that “LinkedIn killers” are trying to capitalize on. While the professional social network giant continues to innovate and scale, there are many concerns that it is straying away from its main value proposition of advancing careers and industry networking. The general consensus is that LinkedIn is declining in the quality of its experience.

In short, it is a discussion about Airbnb’s structure, but it also showcased an organizational chart that went viral within the company and outside of it too. Wylonis <a href=\"https://medium.com/the-org/why-we-started-the-org-986bd278ece8\">writes</a>, </p><blockquote><em>“It seemed obvious to me why somebody outside of Airbnb would be interested in this information. Org charts provide insight into a company’s decision-making hierarchy and makes it easier to find the most relevant person to contact. Not only can you see everyone who works at the company, but you get a better understanding of their responsibilities and their decision-making abilities. What really interested me was why this article was going viral inside of Airbnb. According to company insiders, the article was a hot discussion topic among employees and was even discussed at board level. Org charts have historically been an internal tool that nobody cared about but making it public completely changed the dynamics. Employees were frustrated about being omitted and other mistakes in the org chart.</em><br></blockquote><p>Essentially, he realized that there was a need for transparency in organizational charts, not to mention that there is vastly inaccurate company information out there in places such as LinkedIn and Crunchbase. Wylonis pitched to Jarbøl, “We’re going to build every org chart in the world, let people edit the org charts, and that’s how we’re going to build the world’s biggest platform for teams.” The pitch was well-received and in no time, the duo began their journey. </p><p><strong>Part 3: The Product</strong></p><p>It’s easy to assume that org charts arn’t too critical for a company. But in reality, they are incredibly important for a couple reasons: reporting, long-term planning, restructuring, aligning goals, and managing/leading people. In simple terms, it reflects how the business is fundamentally composed and the responsibilities that come from it’s facets. They date back to 1855, with the first one being created and designed by Daniel McCallum, a Scottish-American railroad engineer and general manager of the New  York and Erie Railroad (drawn by George Holt Henshaw). The first org chart was the intricate, flowery tree-like diagram attached here. The original purpose of it was to depict the divisions of responsibilities and the number of employees in each department of the railroad system  that McCallum managed. McCallum believed that diagramming the   division of responsibilities would establish a sense of order and make relationships and hierarchies more clear. He also believed that it was a necessity to make all of this transparent.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bb2oTTOafiXAhm3ta9vjmZ88rZxr725NCQOzP4Gn6pxo6wONtf3b5HTOSMR9yPsYraoim-r4yDf0tsxmkMkUviAltfmukPannzmfPSHuW0gHsW4EW_l5YbtspZMzywmevP47UuC1\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p><br></p><p>The next major evolution of the org chart came in 1896, when Herman Hollerith founded the Tabulating Machine Company. He created it after he was awarded a federal contract to develop a machine to count the number of immigrants to America at the height of the Industrial Revolution. The company took on multiple product launches, consolidations, and mergers, eventually being renamed to the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR). The business expanded quickly and needed a form of visualization for the relationships and hierarchies within it. Out of this  need came the org chart that  we know today: a nearly- symmetrical, pyramidal form with functional divisions. In addition, the divisions portrayed the geographical and departmental subcategories of each function. As a plot twist, the CTR went on to eventually become International Business Machines, or IBM.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/rl1oOT6coMU2jRkKMYZyMp6_q1jXOg3wTuyElpszAySZBE38JNHTq5rMCN-PZPiMZmZgO9jBXS1q2Ug2Gr6YrF7C_9yiRuK-w7aOhgL0E6ghVEUCl0sNAvtalQ3zqX-e2AJ02lv_\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>The CTR diagram popularized the org charts that we see today. After decades upon decades, org charts have seen innovation in themselves with different forms being applied to different types  of companies. For example, now we have more than just hierarchical org structures: Functional, Horizontal (flat), Divisional (market-based, product-based, geographic), Matrix, Team-based, and Network (hub-and-spoke) org structures. Considering all of that, the general consensus about org charts is that they reflect the dynamic of the company and that they are of critical importance to establish if the company wants to scale. Intuitively,  they show the structure of the company and everything that comes with it. This is, in fact, very important for people such as those in sales, recruiting, and management (product, project, general, etc.). Historically, companies tended to keep accurate org charts secret to protect against others poaching their employees or copying their structure. However, that perspective is changing. How, org charts are becoming more and more transparent, and The Org is capitalizing on that.  </p><p>The Org’s website sheds some light into its mission and vision:</p><blockquote><em>“Who are your company’s unsung heroes? The superstars? The ones who get things done? Businesses aren’t made of bricks and clicks, businesses are made of people, and the best businesses find a way to show that their people are appreciated, celebrated, and honored in the workplace.\"</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>\"We believe a company’s greatest asset is its people. This includes the folks that are never highlighted on the company website, never lauded in the press, and never showcased to the outside world on professional networking sites. We believe that if we can shine a light on these people, everyone will benefit.\"</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>\"We’re making organizations more transparent, and as a result, we’ll understand more about our own companies, the people in them, and finally sing the songs of the true heroes.”</em></blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/MxBRXlUPRkB-jkoRGlLhIh7dSzu8tphads86HMG1hxgqasOHNtzt7BLQTulH_U-w2ZqTDsgKTrMkIFbN5PmRv7R2FLgoOt7Z2WqrNCILMBd0lNItMRLRTB-9wz5T9_o0OKeyhrnM\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/4eYd_PlzS05AzaFJDMFFBZ3sAJ1ixBCgTSJj356dc3uBliF4KSFR1Bx9qXM7OyBRJrK4HxZEL7Xvzk8IlbT6ZTji26_8lLhBhKknF4nEReR1yPUMnfVvQfrFZtu0SdianqAp-MsS\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>To fulfill these goals, The Org established an open-source community of organizational charts of businesses worldwide. With their public-facing database, they plan to provide services such as job updates, job postings, and a platform for teams. While you can search for a specific business, The Org begins by categorizing institutions by their country or by their industry. Thus, users and followers of a specific country or industry can find relevant information for their own context without being bombarded by others. Then, users can log in and browse specific companies that match their target criteria and study how it is structured. At first glance, The Org only offers the chart of a company’s leadership team. For a deeper, more specific look into the structure, users have to make a free account (as of now) to access the niche information.  For example, here is the limited <a href=\"https://theorg.com/org/apple\">org chart for Apple</a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/t9k9dp2TOezb5ZEPQbZJihMZghGPo0N30HNWFoq6w-79LO-PU5dvm3M7YA4GPTjPT5QqpCzKM-WgDgfx7FjGZPkXQuqVcDt5z1qsLaKeQQjMkCwVu0aWwlzdZgTuWUgyvX5HDvbs\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Another key aspect of how The Org makes these charts is how they get the information. It would be extremely  tedious to contact every single company out there and interrogate them for their org charts, which are sometimes proprietary information. Thus, The Org crowdsources the information from people at these firms. They verify the people based on their official email formats from their company. Verified users can go into the org chart of their company and modify it by adding, deleting, or editing the existing structure. All of this is supported by The Org’s research team, which uses public data sources for some of the work as well. To clarify, The Org’s services are currently free of charge. They have not publicly announced their entire business model. </p><p>Altogether, The Org is setting out to solve a problem in professional social networks that Linkedin can’t: accurate organizational charts and company structure. LinkedIn has no way of keeping up with leadership teams and the unsung heroes that may get lost in a network of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd degree connections. Simply put, LinkedIn fails to put together a verified collection of current leaders and employees. Furthermore, a major pain point today is that organizations lack transparency in how they are built. Sometimes, they are not publicly available, are misleading, or are entirely outdated. This is where The Org shines. Wylonis and Jarbøl devised a solution to this by aggregating data from innumerable public data sources and then crowdsourcing the verification process. Currently, their product is free to use, but the business model has secretive plans to monetize in the future. Among other unknown plans, Wylonis said that The Org may place a premium on power searchers, such as sales, recruiting, and business development leaders, and give them access to even more tools. </p><p>As they work towards their goal of mapping out every company, The Org has profiled 50,000 companies and 200,000 professionals in its database. The website reaches nearly 100,000 people per month. Those people are usually from two distinct target markets:</p><ul><li>External - those who are interested in a company’s dynamic and navigating leadership, such as recruiters, HR professionals, professional social network users, etc.</li><li>Internal - those within a company, from people on the board to individual employees looking to see who they work with and for.</li></ul><p>By the end of 2020, The Org plans to have 100,000 organization charts on its platform and is focusing on tracking US companies before expanding. In the long term, that number is 1 million. </p><p><strong>Part 4: Strategy</strong></p><p>OrgTech? I’m not sure if that name will catch on. But, The Org — and a few other startups — recognize the market for transparency in companies, which is portrayed through organizational charts. Having a centralized and accurate collection of this information, not to mention crowdsourcing-induced network effects, provides a valuable, in-depth look into the company’s dynamics value for all of the stakeholders of a company. Even major venture capitalists realize this. Roelof Botha, partner at Sequoia Capital, says that “today, information about teams is unstructured, scattered, and unverified, making it hard for employees and recruiters to understand organizational structures.” The Org directly alleviates that concern with it’s community of verified organizational information. Many in Silicon Valley and tech ecosystems worldwide even agree that org charts have been the secret weapon to forging partnerships and business model innovation. Similarly, former LinkedIn executive Keith Rabois, who is also a board member for The Org, emphasizes the importance of accurate organizational charts: “up-to-date org charts can be useful for everything from recruiting to sales, but they are difficult and time consuming to piece together… The Org is making this valuable information easily accessible in a way we were never able to do at LinkedIn.” Considering all this, it becomes clear that The Org is undertaking a pain-staking task. But, their strategy in doing so is innovative in its own way. </p><p><em>Community-driven crowdsourcing</em>. The Org strategically created a community of transparency and giving back that benefits them in the long run. Take their crowdsourcing strategy, which allows people to modify the organizational charts for their place of employment (users are verified by their company’s unique email addresses). The crowdsourced, wiki-style strategy allows for constantly updated organizational charts without The Org having to individually source the information through publicly available sources. It’s user-generated content, but as accurate and up-to-date as can be. Crowdsourcing is especially valuable because it allows The Org to focus on building out other services and forms of (future) monetization while spending tangibly less resources for it’s biggest product offering. This yields benefits such as:</p><ol><li>Reduces management burden with the faster co-creation of org charts by the public</li><li>The give-and-take nature creates an opportunity for greater customer engagement before other services are rolled out</li><li>Data-driven network effects, or exponentially more value for all with one more user and their company’s org chart updates</li><li>A platform for distributed value-add that creates a flywheel: more crowdsourcing → more submissions for their respective company’s org charts →  more accurate + constantly verified org charts →  more transparency and value for others → more crowdsourcing</li></ol><p><em>Data moats: Invade, then Conquer. </em>The Org emphasizes transparency in how some of the most successful companies are structured, thus offering a resource for organizational structure for others. While there is no set guide on how to do so, the organizational charts allow external users to experiment with teams and leadership capacities within their own firm. Managing a design team? Check out Airbnb’s Chief Design Officer’s team. Leading an engineering team? Reference one from SpaceX. Curious how to establish a company hierarchy? Check out the hierarchy that Apple implemented to surpass a $1T market cap. The possibilities for experimentation are nearly endless. The biggest surface-level concern for this is that some companies may want to operate in stealth. But, The Org found that almost 99% of companies so far have been fine with their product. There have been very few cases of individual people asking to be taken off their company’s organizational chart, but most accept that transparency and showcasing talent is of the best interest of those inside and outside of the company. </p><p>With that, the crucial thing to note is that The Org is playing a long-term game as it's keeping its products free while offering transparency in org charts and a plethora of other services. Keeping their business model free allows for more engaged users to incorporate their own content, which will ultimately bolster The Org’s defensibility. The data that The Org holds thus becomes proprietary and sets the stage for a potentially compounding <a href=\"https://medium.com/eniacvc/compounding-economic-moats-for-technology-companies-f593a5d4688\">moat</a>. Coined by Warren Buffe, the term “moat” is a company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage over its rivals and protect its long-term profitability and market share. Data moats have enduring value because they enable companies to derive never-before-seen insights to serve their customers, enhance the products, or even sell B2B. Not only does The Org generate data, but they also extract key findings for their community that no one else can make. As they keep up with their rate of org chart generation, The Org will slowly become a leader in a niche that companies like LinkedIn could never appeal to. Yet, once they “invade” that niche and establish themselves as a leader in it, then they can “conquer” other operations without sacrificing bandwidth or customers. This means that as the company bolsters its data moat, there will be a point at which no other company can replicate the value of their product and at which they will have enough market share to delve into lateral services seamlessly. </p><p>In the end, their grand vision is simple. 1) Report the org charts for every possible business they can. 2) Build a community of transparency and value. Then, 3) become a leading professional social network. </p><p><strong>Part 5: Competition</strong></p><p>The org chart market is relatively small in terms of competition, but becoming a professional social network puts The Org in direct competition with many other companies. </p><p>Coincidentally, almost on the same day that The Org announced it’s Series A round, another “OrgTech” startup called ChartHop announced it’s own Series A round, led by Andreessen Horowitz and many other big-name investors. ChartHop is an HR and organizational management platform, so it is not a direct competitor with The Org. The only aspect that they share is that both are trying to streamline the process of making organizational charts. </p><p>However, another set of competitors that The Org faces are existing professional social networks— the biggest one undoubtedly being LinkedIn. LinkedIn has especially cornered the market for data and profiles about individual professionals, careers, and industries. At this point in time, LinkedIn is focusing on lowering the COVID-19-induced unemployment rate by working with Microsoft to teach 25 million people digital skills for a post-COVID economy. That said, the company has some glaring faults that “LinkedIn killers” are trying to capitalize on. While the professional social network giant continues to innovate and scale, there are many concerns that it is straying away from its main value proposition of advancing careers and industry networking. The general consensus is that LinkedIn is declining in the quality of its experience. On one hand, you have a platform conducive for spam and “bots,” and on the other, you have a collection of inaccurate and outdated information regarding the employees of a company and their org structure. In addition, there is no way to filter for spammy people or check the validity of who works where and what relationships they have with the next person. Many believe that the lack of quality in connections, users, and content will lead to the decline of LinkedIn, unless it is fixed sometime soon.</p><p>In response to this, The Org is focusing on where LinkedIn fails: quality information full of signal and rid of noise. You get what you ask for, from company updates to org charts, all without messages about joining a pyramid scheme. Wylonis claims that while “LinkedIn is a compilation of online CVs, [The Org] is more like a CV for your company, where everything happens on a company level.” Not only that, but it’s a verified platform of relationships and the transfer of resources within a company.” That said, The Org is representative of a larger trend in professional social networks.

Among other unknown plans, Wylonis\nsaid that The Org may place a premium on power searchers, such as sales,\nrecruiting, and business development leaders, and give them access to even more\ntools. \n\nAs they work towards their goal of mapping out every company, The Org has\nprofiled 50,000 companies and 200,000 professionals in its database. The website\nreaches nearly 100,000 people per month. Those people are usually from two\ndistinct target markets:\n\n * External - those who are interested in a company’s dynamic and navigating\n   leadership, such as recruiters, HR professionals, professional social network\n   users, etc.\n * Internal - those within a company, from people on the board to individual\n   employees looking to see who they work with and for.\n\nBy the end of 2020, The Org plans to have 100,000 organization charts on its\nplatform and is focusing on tracking US companies before expanding. In the long\nterm, that number is 1 million. \n\nPart 4: Strategy\n\nOrgTech? I’m not sure if that name will catch on. But, The Org — and a few other\nstartups — recognize the market for transparency in companies, which is\nportrayed through organizational charts. Having a centralized and accurate\ncollection of this information, not to mention crowdsourcing-induced network\neffects, provides a valuable, in-depth look into the company’s dynamics value\nfor all of the stakeholders of a company. Even major venture capitalists realize\nthis. Roelof Botha, partner at Sequoia Capital, says that “today, information\nabout teams is unstructured, scattered, and unverified, making it hard for\nemployees and recruiters to understand organizational structures.” The Org\ndirectly alleviates that concern with it’s community of verified organizational\ninformation. Many in Silicon Valley and tech ecosystems worldwide even agree\nthat org charts have been the secret weapon to forging partnerships and business\nmodel innovation. Similarly, former LinkedIn executive Keith Rabois, who is also\na board member for The Org, emphasizes the importance of accurate organizational\ncharts: “up-to-date org charts can be useful for everything from recruiting to\nsales, but they are difficult and time consuming to piece together… The Org is\nmaking this valuable information easily accessible in a way we were never able\nto do at LinkedIn.” Considering all this, it becomes clear that The Org is\nundertaking a pain-staking task. But, their strategy in doing so is innovative\nin its own way. \n\nCommunity-driven crowdsourcing. The Org strategically created a community of\ntransparency and giving back that benefits them in the long run. Take their\ncrowdsourcing strategy, which allows people to modify the organizational charts\nfor their place of employment (users are verified by their company’s unique\nemail addresses). The crowdsourced, wiki-style strategy allows for constantly\nupdated organizational charts without The Org having to individually source the\ninformation through publicly available sources. It’s user-generated content, but\nas accurate and up-to-date as can be. Crowdsourcing is especially valuable\nbecause it allows The Org to focus on building out other services and forms of\n(future) monetization while spending tangibly less resources for it’s biggest\nproduct offering. This yields benefits such as:\n\n 1. Reduces management burden with the faster co-creation of org charts by the\n    public\n 2. The give-and-take nature creates an opportunity for greater customer\n    engagement before other services are rolled out\n 3. Data-driven network effects, or exponentially more value for all with one\n    more user and their company’s org chart updates\n 4. A platform for distributed value-add that creates a flywheel: more\n    crowdsourcing → more submissions for their respective company’s org charts →\n     more accurate + constantly verified org charts →  more transparency and\n    value for others → more crowdsourcing\n\nData moats: Invade, then Conquer. The Org emphasizes transparency in how some of\nthe most successful companies are structured, thus offering a resource for\norganizational structure for others. While there is no set guide on how to do\nso, the organizational charts allow external users to experiment with teams and\nleadership capacities within their own firm. Managing a design team? Check out\nAirbnb’s Chief Design Officer’s team. Leading an engineering team? Reference one\nfrom SpaceX. Curious how to establish a company hierarchy? Check out the\nhierarchy that Apple implemented to surpass a $1T market cap. The possibilities\nfor experimentation are nearly endless. The biggest surface-level concern for\nthis is that some companies may want to operate in stealth. But, The Org found\nthat almost 99% of companies so far have been fine with their product. There\nhave been very few cases of individual people asking to be taken off their\ncompany’s organizational chart, but most accept that transparency and showcasing\ntalent is of the best interest of those inside and outside of the company. \n\nWith that, the crucial thing to note is that The Org is playing a long-term game\nas it's keeping its products free while offering transparency in org charts and\na plethora of other services. Keeping their business model free allows for more\nengaged users to incorporate their own content, which will ultimately bolster\nThe Org’s defensibility. The data that The Org holds thus becomes proprietary\nand sets the stage for a potentially compounding moat\n[https://medium.com/eniacvc/compounding-economic-moats-for-technology-companies-f593a5d4688]\n. Coined by Warren Buffe, the term “moat” is a company’s ability to maintain a\ncompetitive advantage over its rivals and protect its long-term profitability\nand market share. Data moats have enduring value because they enable companies\nto derive never-before-seen insights to serve their customers, enhance the\nproducts, or even sell B2B. Not only does The Org generate data, but they also\nextract key findings for their community that no one else can make. As they keep\nup with their rate of org chart generation, The Org will slowly become a leader\nin a niche that companies like LinkedIn could never appeal to. Yet, once they\n“invade” that niche and establish themselves as a leader in it, then they can\n“conquer” other operations without sacrificing bandwidth or customers. This\nmeans that as the company bolsters its data moat, there will be a point at which\nno other company can replicate the value of their product and at which they will\nhave enough market share to delve into lateral services seamlessly. \n\nIn the end, their grand vision is simple. 1) Report the org charts for every\npossible business they can. 2) Build a community of transparency and value.\nThen, 3) become a leading professional social network. \n\nPart 5: Competition\n\nThe org chart market is relatively small in terms of competition, but becoming a\nprofessional social network puts The Org in direct competition with many other\ncompanies. \n\nCoincidentally, almost on the same day that The Org announced it’s Series A\nround, another “OrgTech” startup called ChartHop announced it’s own Series A\nround, led by Andreessen Horowitz and many other big-name investors. ChartHop is\nan HR and organizational management platform, so it is not a direct competitor\nwith The Org. The only aspect that they share is that both are trying to\nstreamline the process of making organizational charts. \n\nHowever, another set of competitors that The Org faces are existing professional\nsocial networks— the biggest one undoubtedly being LinkedIn. LinkedIn has\nespecially cornered the market for data and profiles about individual\nprofessionals, careers, and industries. At this point in time, LinkedIn is\nfocusing on lowering the COVID-19-induced unemployment rate by working with\nMicrosoft to teach 25 million people digital skills for a post-COVID economy.\nThat said, the company has some glaring faults that “LinkedIn killers” are\ntrying to capitalize on. While the professional social network giant continues\nto innovate and scale, there are many concerns that it is straying away from its\nmain value proposition of advancing careers and industry networking. The general\nconsensus is that LinkedIn is declining in the quality of its experience. On one\nhand, you have a platform conducive for spam and “bots,” and on the other, you\nhave a collection of inaccurate and outdated information regarding the employees\nof a company and their org structure. In addition, there is no way to filter for\nspammy people or check the validity of who works where and what relationships\nthey have with the next person. Many believe that the lack of quality in\nconnections, users, and content will lead to the decline of LinkedIn, unless it\nis fixed sometime soon.\n\nIn response to this, The Org is focusing on where LinkedIn fails: quality\ninformation full of signal and rid of noise. You get what you ask for, from\ncompany updates to org charts, all without messages about joining a pyramid\nscheme. Wylonis claims that while “LinkedIn is a compilation of online CVs, [The\nOrg] is more like a CV for your company, where everything happens on a company\nlevel.” Not only that, but it’s a verified platform of relationships and the\ntransfer of resources within a company.” That said, The Org is representative of\na larger trend in professional social networks. We are constantly seeing the\nrise of verticalized\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/ilkerkoksal/2019/12/21/the-rise-of-niche-and-vertical-social-networks/#581246913582] \nprofessional social networks, which ensure quality and relevancy in users,\ncontent, and opportunities for those within a niche industry, all relative to\nLinkedIn— the gold standard. Take Bravado, a professional social network\nspecifically for sales professionals; Behance, a professional community for\ncreatives; StackOverflow, a platform for developers. Some consumer experts are\neven saying\n[https://medium.com/crv-insights/the-next-1b-consumer-startup-will-be-a-vertical-social-network-heres-why-4b4520fb5db1] \nthat the next unicorn will be a verticalized social network. \n\nFor now, all we can do is wait to see which professional social network will\ntake down the 17-year-old champion that is LinkedIn","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/11/download.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2020-11-28 06:02:12","updated_at":"2021-01-05 21:46:00","published_at":"2020-11-28 06:07:27","custom_excerpt":"A look into The Org; trying to emulate Matthew Ball's Epic Games primer","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"none"},{"id":"600cf1e9e9bece0001a90511","uuid":"26166b13-ebb9-4da7-a82a-2e7809169c42","title":"incubation playbook","slug":"incubation","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"then they should be incubating companies. \"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"if you cant find the right company within a thesis, just make it yourself. \"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"incubating firm doenst leadd first rround - \"]]]],\"ghostVersion\":\"3.0\"}","html":"<p>then they should be incubating companies. </p><p>if you cant find the right company within a thesis, just make it yourself. </p><p>incubating firm doenst leadd first rround - </p>","comment_id":"600cf1e9e9bece0001a90511","plaintext":"then they should be incubating companies. \n\nif you cant find the right company within a thesis, just make it yourself. \n\nincubating firm doenst leadd first rround -","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2021-01-24 04:04:57","updated_at":"2021-08-12 03:49:59","published_at":null,"custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"none"},{"id":"60456754e9bece0001a90545","uuid":"65d77786-f684-4def-bae3-15622d4aeace","title":"Going Down in History","slug":"goals","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"hr\",{}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"**To Make Moonshots**\\n\\nMy book (https://www.amazon.com/Making-Moonshots-Rahul-Rana/dp/163676620X) serves as my guiding principles, now I will put it in action throughout the deeptech ecosystem. \\n\\n* ***VC*:** Become a deeptech venture capital investor, where my primary thesis will be investing in **space, life sciences, climate, and breakthrough companies that progress science & our national interests**. \\n    * Be a full-stack investor: pre-seed/commercialization to growth stages\\n    * Sourcing, evaluating, due diligence\\n    * Picking winners + Convincing them\\n    * Helping companies after the fact \\n* ***Startups*:** Incubate as many moonshot startups as possible.

Some of those projects are great—we now\nhave people working on floating space factories and 3-D printing on the moon—but\nothers are definitely not commercially viable at the moment, especially for\nventure-sized returns. As we seek to go further into deep space, I believe the\nnext big thing is actually closer to us than we thought—very low earth orbit, or\nVLEO. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOverview\n\nFirst, some context on orbits. Historically, humans have used... \n\n * Geostationary orbit (~35,786 km) for weather and worldwide telecommunication\n   satellites mainly because its orbital period matches Earth's rotation—23\n   hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds. Geosynchronous orbit is sometimes\n   interchangeable, although it refers to orbits that are directly above the\n   equator.\n * Medium Earth Orbit (~2000 - 35,786 km) for navigation constellations that\n   balance coverage and quantity of satellites. \n * Low Earth Orbit (< 2000 km) for observation, high resolution imagery, manned\n   missions, and more. Also manufacturing! \n\nVLEO isn't incredibly groundbreaking. At approximately 450 km from the ground,\nwe've used this orbit since the Cold War for reconnaissance missions. Even the\nISS sits around this level. But, my prediction is that we will gradually begin\nto bring LEO and MEO satellites closer to the ground, in turn creating a massive\nopportunity for founders & space investors. \n\nWhy? Because reduced orbital altitudes have benefits such as1:\n\n * Higher performance, resolution, accuracy, and quality of ground imagery,\n   location-based services, and other satellite-enabled functions\n   - Especially for various radars, lidars, etc. \n * Lower development & launch costs per unit mass; smaller & less expensive\n   payloads\n * Shorter distance reduces latency in communications + required power for\n   transmission\n * Being naturally resilient to a build-up in debris due to atmospheric drag =\n   lower risk of collisions.\n * Atmospheric drag also ensures that spacecraft are naturally disposed of after\n   completed missions or systems failures. \n * Less aggressive solar radiation which is favorable to standard electronic\n   components, reducing cost and redundancy.\n * Easier access means satellites can be shuttled, serviced, and revisited\n   quicker + deorbited if necessary as technological improvements move\n   exponentially \n\nMarket\n\n 1. Earth observation\n 2. environmental monitoring, maritime surveillance, intelligence and homeland\n    security, land management and agriculture, meteorology, and disaster\n    monitoring and response management. in boarder security and maritime\n    surveillance higher spatial resolution can facilitate the identification of\n    smaller vehicles and vessels and improve classification [110–112], enabling\n    better assessment of risk and vulnerability. Similarly, for applications\n    such as agriculture, water-security, climate-change, infrastructure\n    monitoring, and location-based services (or asset tracking)\n 3. s spacecraft development, manufacturing, and launch. Operating spacecraft\n    effectively and efficiently in VLEO will also require the development of new\n    technologies, encouraging innovation and disruption in the market.\n 4. VLEO offers opportunities to exploit novel atmosphere-breathing electric\n    propulsion systems and aerodynamic attitude and orbit control methods\n 5. Tailwinds\n    - NewSpace \n    - increasing need to shuttle and service satellites\n    - proliferation of satellites\n    - Recent technology development, in particular component and subsystem\n    miniaturisation\n    - e introduction of frequent and affordable orbital insertion opportunities\n    (in comparison to dedicated launch) from the ISS and the promise of new\n    commercial launch vehicles\n    \n\nChallenges\n\n * The VLEO altitude range is principally characterised by the presence of\n   aerodynamic forces which can have a significant effect on the orbital and\n   attitude dynamics of a spacecraft. The most significant of these is the\n   increased atmospheric density at lower altitudes which increases aerodynamic\n   drag and therefore reduces orbital lifetime.\n * The presence of highly-reactive atomic oxygen, which is typically the most\n   abundant gas species in VLEO, can affect and degrade material performance, in\n   particular sensitive optical sensor surfaces and thermal coatings\n\nOpportunities\n\n * seeks to enable sustained operations at these lower altitudes, for example\n   through the identification and characterisation of low-drag materials and\n   surface coatings, development of aerodynamic attitude and orbit control, and\n   design of propulsive drag compensation - drive down cost, while improve\n   quality of data products. \n * Atmosphere-breathing electric propulsion\n * design of electrodeless thrusters which avoid the erosion of critical\n   components due to the prevalence of oxidising species in the VLEO environment\n * variosu companies \n * identification of materials which are resistant to both erosion by atomic\n   oxygen and can reduce aerodynamic drag is therefore an active area of\n   interest. combined with appropriate spacecraft geometries and platform\n   designs, these materials will also support the exploitation of novel\n   aerodynamic control manoeuvres which can aid sustained operation of\n   spacecraft in lower altitude orbits\n\nValue creation\n\n * why will it be big. benefits, etc. \n\nMarket\n\n * trends\n * plus adjacent markets; industries that it affects + applications\n\nChallenges\n\n * previous limitations and current challenges\n * Despite these wide-ranging benefits, there are still many challenges in\n   operating in the denser regions of the upper atmosphere that mean lower\n   altitude orbits are yet to see commercial exploitation.\n * The most significant issue is the increase in aerodynamic drag experienced by\n   satellites operating at these altitudes. As orbital altitude is reduced,\n   atmospheric density increases, in turn increasing the aerodynamic drag\n   experienced by orbiting spacecraft and limiting their useful lifetime before\n   they decay and burn up in the atmosphere.\n * To provide long-term operations, current satellites therefore have to be\n   equipped with propulsion systems and carry enough fuel (propellant) to last\n   the intended mission duration, increasing launch costs considerably.\n   Alternative operational models include on-orbit refuelling operations, but\n   these approaches are still subject to the issues of launch cost and\n   aerodynamic drag.\n * Variations in the atmospheric density and the presence of thermospheric winds\n   can also have a disturbing effect on the satellite stability and pointing\n   capability. If not compensated for, these effects may have a detrimental\n   effect on image quality or communications networks.\n * The residual atmosphere in low altitude orbits is also rich in\n   highly-reactive atomic oxygen. In combination with the high orbital velocity\n   and thermospheric temperatures, this atomic oxygen can damage the external\n   surfaces of spacecraft through erosion. Sensitive optics, solar arrays, and\n   antennas can also be adversely affected, reducing the mission performance and\n   lifetime of the spacecraft.\n * \n   \n   \n\nInvestable opportunities + thesis\n\n * thesis; guiding principles (we are looking for engines/propulsion as opposed\n   to sat companies) - which elements will comprise the fuels? \n * Technology Development\n * In order to address these challenges and enable the exploitation of lower\n   altitude orbits, several lines of active research and technology development\n   are underway:\n * Experiments to understand the erosion characteristics of atomic oxygen are\n   being performed at facilities around the world, for example at the European\n   Space Agency\n   [https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Engineering_Technology/Atomic_oxygen_generator_simulates_fire_in_the_sky]\n   .\n * Materials that have resistance to atomic oxygen erosion and can also reduce\n   the aerodynamic drag experienced by satellites in orbit are being searched\n   for and developed.
