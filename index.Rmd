## Bio

Rahul Rana is a venture builder and investor who is studying astrophysics and finance at Rutgers University. He is currently a Summer Analyst at General Atlantic where he is investing in frontier tech growth equity. Rahul was previously building a frontier biotech research lab, Arcadia Science, where he focused on incubating startups within the in-house moonshot factory. He recently spent a year as a Venture Associate at Lux Capital, a $4bn deeptech venture capital firm.

At Lux Capital, Rahul sourced & diligenced startups related to space, life sciences, climate, and crypto. He also worked on incubating two startups—a biotech company with the thesis of harnessing the "superpowers" of non-model organisms and biodiversity for human medicines, and a space company.

He is the author of [Making Moonshots](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Moonshots-Rahul-Rana/dp/163676620X)—a deep dive into the mindsets, philosophies, and strategies conducive to building moonshot companies. "Moonshot company" entails three things: taking an advanced science or deep technology and using it in a radical solution to solve a big problem in the world.

He became intrigued by deeptech at an early age when he explored his father’s laboratory at the legendary Bell Labs. Rana has discovered the “ecosystem” of what makes a great moonshot company. He has transferred his fascination with researchers and startups that make giant leaps in scientific and technological progress into a prescription. His call to action for entrepreneurs is to embrace what appears at first glance to be impossible, but is actually quite practical when following the best mindsets and strategies harnessed by those who have come before.  

In the past, Rahul has worked across non-technical roles at startups in the nanotech and AI industries. He has also participated in countless content creation roles at various venture capital firms. Finally, Rahul also interned in the NJ-6 Congressional District Office doing public policy work.
